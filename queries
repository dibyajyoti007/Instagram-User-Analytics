B) Investor Metrics: Our investors want to know if Instagram is performing well and is not becoming redundant like Facebook, they want to assess the app on the following grounds 
1.	User Engagement: Are users still as active and post on Instagram or they are making fewer posts 
           
	Task: Provide how many times does average user posts on Instagram.  
             Sql Query: 
	                >> select (select count(*) from photos) / (select count(*) from users) 
                          as average_post;


2.	Bots & Fake Accounts: The investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts 

Task:  Provide data on users (bots) who have liked every single photo on the site (since any normal user would not be able to do this). 
		Sql Query:
		                    
                        >> select username, count(*) as total_likes 
                          from users
                          right join likes
                          on users.id = likes.user_id

                          having total_likes = (select count(*) from photos);
